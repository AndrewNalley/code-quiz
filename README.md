# <Code-Quiz>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- This quiz was built to test the user on their JavaScript knowledge. The page has increased functionality and enhanced user experience over previous projects, utilizing the DOM and Bootstrap stylings. This project displays the ability of JavaScript to change aspects of the web page on the fly and how it can access local memory. Bootstrap adds quick and easy aesthetic changes. By completing this project, I learned more ways to interact with a basic web page so that it feels live and user-friendly.

## Usage

This quiz is fairly simple to use. You can click start to start the quiz, or you can click the high scores button to see if there are any high scores posted. If there are, you can clear them out with the clear score button. If there are none, then a "No high scores yet!" message will appear above the quiz. 

The quiz: Each question displays four answers as buttons. If you click the right one, "Correct!" displays. If not, "Incorrect." displays. For each correct question, the quiz adds to the score counter and moves on to the next question. If answered incorrectly, the timer is decremented by 10 seconds. When the timer is down to 10 seconds or less, an urgent message will appear. 

The quiz ends either when there are no more questions or when the timer is ended. A field to enter initials and a submit button will appear. When you type in intitials and hit submit, your score and initials will be added to the local memory, and will display on the high score list if the button is clicked.
